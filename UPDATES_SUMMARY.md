# Smart Campus Management System - Updates Summary

## 🎯 All Issues Fixed & Features Enhanced

### ✅ 1. Chat System Fixed
**Issues Resolved:**
- ❌ **Previous Error**: "Chat validation failed: participants.0 is required"
  - **Cause**: Chat routes were using `req.user.userId` instead of `req.userId`
  - **Fixed**: All 6 chat routes updated to use `req.userId || req.user._id`

- ❌ **Previous Error**: "Class constructor ObjectId cannot be invoked without 'new'"
  - **Cause**: Using `mongoose.Types.ObjectId(stringId)` constructor
  - **Fixed**: Changed to direct string assignment `[userIdString, recipientIdString]`
  
**Status**: ✅ Backend restarted with fixes applied
